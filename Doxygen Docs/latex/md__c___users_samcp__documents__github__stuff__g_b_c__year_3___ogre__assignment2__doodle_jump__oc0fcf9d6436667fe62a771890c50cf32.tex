SDL has support for Open\+GL ES 2.\+x under Windows via two alternative implementations. The most straightforward method consists in running your app in a system with a graphic card paired with a relatively recent (as of November of 2013) driver which supports the WGL\+\_\+\+EXT\+\_\+create\+\_\+context\+\_\+es2\+\_\+profile extension. Vendors known to ship said extension on Windows currently include n\+Vidia and Intel.

The other method involves using the ANGLE library (\href{https://code.google.com/p/angleproject/}{\texttt{ https\+://code.\+google.\+com/p/angleproject/}}) If an Open\+GL ES 2.\+x context is requested and no WGL\+\_\+\+EXT\+\_\+create\+\_\+context\+\_\+es2\+\_\+profile extension is found, SDL will try to load the lib\+EGL.\+dll library provided by ANGLE. To obtain the ANGLE binaries, you can either compile from source from \href{https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle}{\texttt{ https\+://chromium.\+googlesource.\+com/angle/angle}} or copy the relevant binaries from a recent Chrome/\+Chromium install for Windows. The files you need are\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}* libEGL.dll
* libGLESv2.dll
* d3dcompiler_46.dll (supports Windows Vista or later, better shader compiler)
or...
* d3dcompiler_43.dll (supports Windows XP or later)
\end{DoxyVerb}
 If you compile ANGLE from source, you can configure it so it does not need the d3dcompiler\+\_\+$\ast$ DLL at all (for details on this, see their documentation). However, by default SDL will try to preload the d3dcompiler\+\_\+46.\+dll to comply with ANGLE\textquotesingle{}s requirements. If you wish SDL to preload d3dcompiler\+\_\+43.\+dll (to support Windows XP) or to skip this step at all, you can use the SDL\+\_\+\+HINT\+\_\+\+VIDEO\+\_\+\+WIN\+\_\+\+D3\+DCOMPILER hint (see \mbox{\hyperlink{_s_d_l__hints_8h}{SDL\+\_\+hints.\+h}} for more details).

Known Bugs\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}* SDL_GL_SetSwapInterval is currently a no op when using ANGLE. It appears
  that there's a bug in the library which prevents the window contents from
  refreshing if this is set to anything other than the default value.

Support for creating Vulkan surfaces is configured on by default. To disable it change the value of {\ttfamily SDL\+\_\+\+VIDEO\+\_\+\+VULKAN} to 0 in {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{_s_d_l__config__windows_8h_source}{SDL\+\_\+config\+\_\+windows.\+h}}}. You must install the \href{https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/}{\texttt{ Vulkan SDK}} in order to use Vulkan graphics in your application.
