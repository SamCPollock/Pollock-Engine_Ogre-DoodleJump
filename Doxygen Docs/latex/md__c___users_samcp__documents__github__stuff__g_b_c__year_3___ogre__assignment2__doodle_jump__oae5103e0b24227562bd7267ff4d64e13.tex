The latest development version of SDL is available via git. Git allows you to get up-\/to-\/the-\/minute fixes and enhancements; as a developer works on a source tree, you can use \char`\"{}git\char`\"{} to mirror that source tree instead of waiting for an official release. Please look at the Git website ( \href{https://git-scm.com/}{\texttt{ https\+://git-\/scm.\+com/}} ) for more information on using git, where you can also download software for mac\+OS, Windows, and Unix systems. \begin{DoxyVerb}git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL
\end{DoxyVerb}
 If you are building SDL via configure, you will need to run autogen.\+sh before running configure.
